        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This tea has all the flavor of of black tea but none of the caffeine. The fermentation process brings out the tannins and earthiness of the leaf.</p>
        <p>Blackberry brambles are everywhere and there is no species of the genus Rubus that cannot be used here. Choose the younger leaves with the fewest thorns and wear gloves.</p>
